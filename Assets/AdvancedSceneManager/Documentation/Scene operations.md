# Scene operations

A scene operation in ASM is a basically a queued batch operation for opening and closing scenes. 

At its most basic form, it takes a list of scenes to close, and a list of scenes to open. Scenes are then evaluated (*scene must be open to be closed, and must be closed to be opened*), and then closes and opens them.

On top of that you got some bells and whistles, like [loading screens](Loading%20screens.md), [coroutine callbacks](Scene%20callbacks.md), [temporary thread priority switching](Scene%20manager%20window.md#collection-popup), and [automatically unloading unused assets](Scene%20manager%20window.md#collection-popup). Scene operation will also report overall progress.

Scene operation also supports spam checking, and duplicate checking, preventing button spam for example, though it should be noted that the most fool-proof way is still to disable buttons or similar.

## API

Scene operations is the core level API in ASM, all other functions use it, more information about the different layers of APIs here:\
[An overview of ASM API structure](An%20overview%20of%20ASM%20API%20structure.md)

An operation can be started in code by using either of these two:\
`SceneOperation.Queue()`\
`SceneOperation.Start() //Ignores queue`

```csharp
public Scene[] scenesToOpen;
public Scene loadingScene;

public void OnButtonClick() =>
	SceneOperation.Queue().
		Open(sceneToOpen).
		Close(SceneManager.openScenes).
		With(loadingScene);
```

### Fluent API

As you can also see above, SceneOperation supports a fluent API, allowing for things like this:

```csharp

SceneManager.runtime.Open(sceneToOpen).Close(closeAlreadyOpenScene).With(loadingScreenScene);

//This is functionally equivalent to above
sceneToOpen.Open().Close(closeAlreadyOpenScene).With(loadingScreenScene);

```

> You should have a look at `.With(..)` using intellisense, or in the [api documentation](../api/Core.SceneOperation.md), it has many overloads for various different things.

### Callbacks

Scene operations supports callbacks, not only [scene callbacks](Scene%20callbacks.md), but also direct callbacks.

```csharp
public void OnButtonClick()
{

	SceneOperation.Queue().
		Open(sceneToOpen).
		Close(sceneToClose).
		With(loadingScreenScene).
		Callback(Callback.AfterLoadingScreenOpen().Do(() => Debug.Log("Loading screen has opened"))).
		Callback(Callback.BeforeLoadingScreenClose().Do(() => Debug.Log("Loading screen is about to close"))).
		Callback(Callback.After(Phase.UnloadScenes).Do(() => Debug.Log("Scenes unloaded"))).
		Callback(Callback.Before(Phase.LoadScenes, sceneToOpen).Do(() => Debug.Log("SceneToOpen is about to be opened"))).
		Callback(Callback.After(Phase.LoadScenes, sceneToOpen).Do(() => Debug.Log("SceneToOpen has opened"))).
		Callback(Callback.BeforeLoadingScreenClose().Do(() => DoDelay(5)));

}

IEnumerator DoDelay(float delay)
{
	yield return new WaitForSecondsRealtime(delay);
}
```
